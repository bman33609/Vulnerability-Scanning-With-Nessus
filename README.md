<h1>Vulnerability Scanning With Nessus</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project consists of installing a virtual machine, making it vulnerable to attacks by disabling all firewalls on vm and then performing several types of vulnerability scans with tenable Nessus. Finally, we will analyze results and find suggestions within Nessus to help remediate those threats/vulnerabilities.</p>



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>VirtualBox</b> 
- <b>Nessus</b>
- <b>Command Line</b>
- <b>Windows Defender</b>
  
<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b> VirtualBox</b>
- <b> Windows</b>
- <b> Web Browser</b> 

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

- <b>Spin up virtual machine.</b> 
- <b>Install Nessus.</b>
- <b>Locate vm IP address.</b> 
- <b>Run a basic uncredentialed network scan on the target IP address.</b> 
- <b>Analyze results of basic scan.</b>
- <b>Run a basic credentialed network scan on the target IP address</b>
- <b>Analyze results of the credentialed scan.</b>
- <b>Use Nessus to find ways to remediate vulnerabilities and potential threats.</b>
- <b>Remediate the threats and vulnerabilities on the virtual machine.</b>
- <b>Run a follow-up scan to see if vulnerabilities/potential threats have been remediated</b>

<br />
 Let's make the vm vulnerable to attacks by disabling all firewalls via Windows Defender: <br/>

<br />

<br />
  Next, let's download Nessus: <br/>

<br />

<br />
   Now that Nessus has been installed, we need to locate the vm's IP: <br/>

<br />

<br />
Run a basic uncredentialed network scan against the target IP address:  <br/>

<br />

<br />
Now, run a credentialed scan:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Let's view all the vulnerabilities that were found:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now, let's dive into one of the vulnerabilities that were found and see what we can learn about it:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Let's see what Nessus recommends us to do in order to remediate these vulnerabilities:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Nessus suggests installing updates and re-enabling our firewalls so let's do that:  <br/>

<br />

<br />
Now, let's scan again to see if the vulnerabilities have been removed:  <br/>

<h2>Findings:</h2>

- <b> Using Nessus can be instrumental in scanning a network device for various types of threats and vulnerablities.</b>
- <b> Nessus is very customizable and makes it easy to optimize your scans for specific purposes in a timely fashion.</b>
- <b> Credentialed scans are generally much more in depth and will help discover the majority of current vulnerabilities.</b>
- <b> Nessus gives us a categorical breakdown of vulnerabilties and offers steps to remediate each type of vulnerabilty.</b>
- <b> Upon diving into a particular vulnerability, Nessus will provide detailed information including port numbers, degree of severity, and many supportive reference links to assist in your investigations. In regards to the vulnerability shown above(SMB Signing Not 
      Required), Nessus told us that an unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this via man-in-the-middle attack. To mitigate this, Nessus recommends us to enforce message signing in the host's configuartion.</b>
- <b> In addition, Nessus recommended us to turn our firewalls back on and install all suggested updates on our vm.
